This program will help in creating special VeraCrypt / TrueCrypt containers suited for this special version:

This program will as well as preparing a special container, also output a sample batch script with example command to load the container.

This particular program hides VeraCrypt/TrueCrypt container inbetween 2 concatenated zip files on target. Choose any file and they will be merged with the container in the middle. Pay attention to corruption in host file format when appending. Zip and jpg files seems best.
